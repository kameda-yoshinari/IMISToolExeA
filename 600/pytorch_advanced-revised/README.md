You should visit and run [0_0_pytorch_advanced_setup.ipynb](https://github.com/kameda-yoshinari/IMISToolExeA2021/blob/main/600/pytorch_advanced-revised/0_0_pytorch_advanced_setup.ipynb) when you come here for the first time.  

Then you can choose chapters. On each chapter, you should go through ipynb files from the smaller number to the larger, one by one (since some ipynb relies on the previous ipynb).
